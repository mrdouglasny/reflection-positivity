# Transfer matrix construction on the physical Hilbert space

For a reflection-positive measure `μ` with a time-translation symmetry
`τ : Ω → Ω` commuting appropriately with the reflection `θ`, the
pairing `(F, G) ↦ ⟨F · (G ∘ τ ∘ θ)⟩` descends to a bounded positive
self-adjoint operator `T_μ` on the physical Hilbert space `H_phys`
(constructed in `CauchySchwarz.lean`).

**The mass-gap operator-norm bound** captured here is the input that
`VarianceBound.lean` consumes to produce the Layer B2 variance bound
for pphi2's discharge. Crucially, this is an **algebraic** statement
(operator norm on the orthogonal complement of the vacuum), NOT a
spectral statement — so we do NOT depend on Mathlib's WIP bounded
self-adjoint spectral theorem.

## Main definitions (planned)

* `MeasureTheory.Measure.IsReflectionPositive.transferMatrix τ` —
  the bounded self-adjoint positive operator `T_μ` on `H_phys`,
  constructed from the time-translation `τ`.
* `MeasureTheory.Measure.IsReflectionPositive.vacuum` — the
  distinguished vacuum vector `Ω` in `H_phys` (image of the constant
  function `1` under the quotient).
* `MeasureTheory.Measure.IsReflectionPositive.vacuumOrthogonal` — the
  orthogonal complement of `ℂ Ω` in `H_phys`.

## Main theorems (planned)

* `MeasureTheory.Measure.IsReflectionPositive.transferMatrix_selfAdjoint`
* `MeasureTheory.Measure.IsReflectionPositive.transferMatrix_positive`
* `MeasureTheory.Measure.IsReflectionPositive.transferMatrix_norm_le_one`
  — `‖T_μ‖ ≤ 1` (the vacuum eigenvalue is the spectral radius).
* `MeasureTheory.Measure.IsReflectionPositive.transferMatrix_vacuum_eq`
  — `T_μ Ω = Ω` (vacuum is invariant).
* `MeasureTheory.Measure.IsReflectionPositive.MassGapBound` — a
  predicate / structure: `‖T_μ|_{H_perp}‖ ≤ exp(-m · a)` for some
  `m > 0` (where `a` is the time-step spacing). This is the
  algebraic shape of "mass gap"; it does NOT require spectral
  resolution of `T_μ`. The concrete instance (cylinder lattice)
  proves this via pphi2's `asymMassGap_pos`.

## Note: no spectral theorem needed for the critical path

The `MassGapBound` predicate captures the mass gap as an operator-norm
restriction on the orthogonal complement of the vacuum — a pure
operator-theoretic statement that requires only the algebraic
orthogonal decomposition `H_phys = ℂ Ω ⊕ H_perp` and the bounded
operator restriction lemma. Both are in Mathlib's current
functional-analysis layer. The "spectral" interpretation
(`λ₁ ≤ e^{-ma}`) is recovered when needed but not required for
`VarianceBound.lean`.

## This file: the abstract operator core

We first develop the **operator-theoretic core** that the Layer B2
variance bound rests on, independent of the measure-theoretic
construction: a `GappedTransfer` — a self-adjoint contraction `T` on a
real inner product space fixing a vacuum vector, with an operator-norm
gap `‖T v‖ ≤ γ ‖v‖` (`γ < 1`) on the orthogonal complement of the
vacuum. From the gap we derive that `T` preserves the vacuum-orthogonal
complement and that `‖T ^ n v‖ ≤ γ ^ n ‖v‖` there — the input
`VarianceBound.lean` turns into a uniform susceptibility bound.

The construction of such a `T` from a reflection-positive measure on
`H_phys` (the analytic RP contraction estimate + extension to the
completion) is the remaining concrete bridge, deferred to a later step.
